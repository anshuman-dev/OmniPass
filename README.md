# OmniPass - Cross-Chain Credential Passport

A proof-of-concept application that allows users to maintain a unified digital identity across multiple blockchains.

## Motivation

The blockchain ecosystem is severely fragmented, with users building separate identities, reputations, and credentials across multiple chains. This fragmentation creates significant pain points:

- Identity Silos: Users need to rebuild their reputation on each new chain they interact with
- Credential Verification Challenges: Projects can't easily verify a user's activity across the entire ecosystem
- Wasted User History: Valuable reputation data gets locked in chain-specific silos
- Higher Friction: Extra steps needed to prove identity across chains

LayerZero solves this by enabling true omnichain applications. Our Credential Passport demonstrates this power through a practical, real-world use case that showcases all three core LayerZero technologies.

## Features

- Create a unified credential passport NFT
- Add cross-chain credentials that automatically sync across blockchains
- Verify credentials from any chain without moving your passport
- Track cross-chain transactions and credential history

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Backend: Python, FastAPI
- Cross-Chain Messaging: LayerZero (OApp, ONFT, OFT)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in GitHub Codespaces
3. Run the application locally
4. Connect your wallet
5. Create your passport and add credentials
